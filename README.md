![Application](https://github.com/alexiyous/Newsery/blob/main/Images/for_revered_broski.png)

This is an application for finding international news, news about your ex, your mother, your father who never comes home, or about software engineers who have not found a job and are forced to grind leetcode trying to inverse arrays.

You can share news or even bookmark it for later.

The basic stack and design patterns used include:

- Koin (Dependency Injection)
- Jetpack Compose (UI Interaction)
- Kotlin (Ofcourse, native's better)
- Coil (Loading online images)
- Retrofit (Having a "relationship" with the backend)
- Room (Database)
- Dynamic Feature (I implement this for my final project, it doesn't have any useful actually)
- Pager3
- Coroutine Flow
- MVVM
- Clean Architecture (For the OCD's out there)
